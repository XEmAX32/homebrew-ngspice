Macos (intel chip) Ngspice brew formula.

Use: "brew install xemax32/ngspice"

Highly based on:
- Gonzaga Ngspice install guide (http://web02.gonzaga.edu/faculty/talarico/vlsi/CADToolsOnMac.html)
- Brew ngspice official formula (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/ngspice.rb)

Note: it has never been tested on ARM architecture.
